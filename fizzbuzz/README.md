# Fizzbuzz

## Task
Implement a function fizzbuzz in [fizzbuzz.py](fizzbuzz.py) that takes two numbers as an argument and returns a list of all number from the first argument up to (excluding) the second argument. For multiples of three include `"Fizz"` instead of the number, for multiples of five `"Buzz"`. For a number which is a multiple of both three and five include `"FizzBuzz"`.

## How to run the code
You can run the tests by simply calling `python3 test_fizzbuzz.py` from within this directory. You can replace `python3` with `python` if you want to use python2 instead.

## How to write tests
The test file [test_fizzbuzz.py](test_fizzbuzz.py) contains an example test case with an example (failing) test that you can easily adjust. Just add more methods, starting with `test_`, to this class to add additional tests.
