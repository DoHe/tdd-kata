# TDD Kata

Some small katas for a TDD workshop. Check each subdirectory's README for more information on the particular kata.
Keep in mind the "_three laws_":

1. You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test
2. You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing
3. You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test

And the "_five steps_":

1. Add a test
2. Run all tests, check if new test fails
3. Write the code
4. Run all tests, check if all pass
5. Refactor code
